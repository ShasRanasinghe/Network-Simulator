##SYSC 3110 Group Project: Network Routing Simulator
###Group Members: Alex Hoecht, Andrew Ward, Mohamed Dahrouj, Shasthra Ranasinghe

###Summary:
----------------------------------------------
The goal of this team project is to build a simulator to evaluate the performance of various routing
algorithms. This project will implement the following routing algorithms:
* Random
* Flooding
* Shortest path
* Custom method

A user interface will be implemented for the simulator to display the network topology and let the user edit it. The interface will always provide the metrics of the network and the ability to view and step through a simulation.

###Milestones:
----------------------------------------------
The project is divided into 4 iterations, each of which correspond to a milestone with deliverables.

| Milestone | Description| Due Date      | Weight|
| --------- | ---------- |-------------- |-------|
| 1         | A simple console-based version. Only the random algorithm will be implemented. | Oct 21 | 15%|
| 2         | GUI and unit tests.  |Nov 7| 20% |
| 3         | All routing algorithms are to be implemented and selectable through the GUI. |Nov 21 | 30%|
| 4         | Add the ability to step back in a network (i.e. undo function) and the ability to save/restore a simulation of the network topology.  | Dec 5 | 35%|


###How to Run
----------------------------------------------
1) Download submitted .zip folder from CULearn

2) "Extract All" files from .zip folder into a specified directory

3) In the command prompt, either specify the directory the .zip folder was extracted to, or copy the file "milestone3.jar" to the
   M-Drive directory (If on Carleton University computer).
   
4) Type the following into the command propmt to begin executing the program: **java -jar milestone3.jar**

5) For any further help with the program, refer to 'Help'->'User Manual' in the GUI.


###Notes
----------------------------------------------
As requested, a .docx file has been added to the project. The UML diagrams, design choices, assumptions, developer contributions have been moved to the .docx along with the contents of this README.
