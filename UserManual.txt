Initialize Network:
_______________________

When 'Milestone4.jar' is executed the user will be prompted to use to the default network (Specified in the Project Requirements)

        1)If the user selects 'Default', the network will be initialized with following default settings:
	
                Routers in simulation: A B C D E
		
                Edges in Simulation: A->B A->C A->E B->D B->E C->D
		
                Message creation frequency: 1 message / 5 hops
		
                Algorithm: Random
		
        2)If the user selects 'New Network', it will be up to the user to initialize their own Routing Network
	
        NOTE:Once the simulation of the network has been started (IE: the user presses the 'Step' or 'Run" button)

                the manipulation of the network will be limited.



User Interaction with Network Graphic:
________________________________________

- Any node(Router)/edge created in the network will be displayed in the GUI

- The user may click and drag nodes to move them around the GUI

       - The position of the nodes in the network does not affect the functionality of
	
             the network. (Purely Aesthetic)
	
		
NOTE: If a node is selected(Surrounded by rectangle), and if the user tries to use any
 
                of the following functionalities, the behavior will be applied to the selected
		
                node (without prompting the user, Be Careful!!!)



Functionality of User Interface:
__________________________________

After the Network GUI has been initialized, the user can use the following functionality to manipulate the Network:

        1) BUTTONS:	
          _________
	  
                        'New Node' - prompts the user to provide an 'id' for the Router being added to the network
                        __________
			
                        'New Edge' - prompts the user for two 'Router ids' to connect with the edge
                        __________
			
                        'Set Frequency' - prompts the user to set the 'Message Creation Frequency' of the simulation
                        _______________
			
                                 [NOTE: when selecting frequency the user must highlight the integer field in order
				
                                        for the frequency to be set. Refer to STATUS bar at bottom of GUI to 
					
                                        ensure frequency is set properly. (Bug will be fixed in next milestone)]
					
					
                        'Set Algorithm' - prompts the user to select the desired algorithm to be applied to the 
                        _______________
                                           network.
						
						
                        'Delete Node' - IF NO NODE IS SELECTED - the user will be prompted to provided an id of the
                        _______________
                                           Router to be deleted from the network
							
						
                                      - IF NODE IS SELECTED - the currently selected Router will be deleted from 
				      	  
                                           the network
							
							
                                  [NOTE: Deleting a Router, deletes any and all edges connected to it.]
				
				
                        'Delete Edge' - prompts the user to specify the Source/Destination Routers to identify
                        _____________
                                        which edge will be deleted

                        'Reset' - Resets the metrics of the current network so that it can be used once again
                        _______			
                                        without having to rebuild the network.
                                        
                                        
                        'Average Hops' - Calculates the average hops of messages with the same source and destination pair.
                        _____________			
                                        Displayed as JTable in a pop up. Can be seen at any time during run time.
                                        
                                        Displays source, destination, number of messages with same source/destination and average.  
                                        
                        'Step Back' - Steps the network to its previously saved state, allowing the user to traverse forward and                                  
						___________	
										backward through the execution of the network.
							
							
                        'Run' - Runs the currently configured network simulation, and displays each step of
                        ______
                                        the simulation until it terminates. Each 'Hop' taken by each message is shown
					
                                        in the generated table (above the graph). Each message created in the simulation
					
                                        is displayed in a list (right of the graph). Each message in the list is clickable
					
                                        to see its Source and Destination. If the message is highlighted in GREEN, the
					
                                        message is still transferred in the network. If the message is highlighted in
					
                                        RED, the message has reached its Destination and has terminated.
					
					
                        'Next' - Simulates one 'Hop' in the simulation, and returns the new state of the Simulation to
                        ______
